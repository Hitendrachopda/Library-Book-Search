	 * When populating this file, consider the following flow
	 * of control:
	 * - This method should be static
	 * - Check if the $_REQUEST content actually is the plugin name
	 * - Run an admin referrer check to make sure it goes through authentication
	 * - Verify the output of $_GET makes sense
	 * - Repeat with other user roles. Best directly by using the links/query string parameters.
	 * - Repeat things for multisite. Once for a single site in the network, once sitewide.
